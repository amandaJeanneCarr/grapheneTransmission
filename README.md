# grapheneOpticalTransmission

Full codes written in Python and Jupyter Notebook for all data analysis and processing of spatially-resolved optical transmission data. Briefly, codes determine the likelihood graphene is present based on a probability density function analysis of optical transmission data measured with respect to sample area.

Additional notes are included in each individual code. For more detailed information, see A. J. Carr, "Application-guided experimental characterizations of nanocompositefilms and interfaces," doctoral dissertation, Stony Brook University, 2020.
